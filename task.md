# **Node.js Developer Test Task**

Welcome to the KeyM hiring process for Node.js developers\! This test task is designed to assess your backend development skills using Node.js with either Express.js or NestJS.

## **Task Description**

You will create a simple backend service for managing a booking system. The service should expose a REST API (or GraphQL if preferred) that allows users to book time slots. Follow the requirements and guidelines below.

---

### **Requirements**

#### **1\. API Endpoints**

Your service should support the following functionality:

* **Create a Booking**  
  * Endpoint: `POST /bookings`

Request Body:  
{  
  "user": "User's name",  
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",  
  "startTime": "HH:mm",  
  "endTime": "HH:mm"

}

* Response: Return the created booking with a unique ID.  
  * **Important:** Ensure that there is no overlap of slots for the same date and time range.  
* **Get All Bookings**  
  * Endpoint: `GET /bookings`  
  * Response: Return a list of all bookings.  
* **Get a Booking by ID**  
  * Endpoint: `GET /bookings/:id`  
  * Response: Return the booking with the specified ID.  
* **Delete a Booking**  
  * Endpoint: `DELETE /bookings/:id`  
  * Response: Confirm deletion.

#### **2\. Data Validation**

* Validate incoming request data using a library such as `Joi` or built-in validation from NestJS.  
* Ensure all required fields are present and in the correct format.  
* Validate that `startTime` is earlier than `endTime` and the time slot is within the same day.

#### **3\. Conflict Handling**

* Implement logic to ensure no overlapping bookings for the same date and time range.  
* Return an appropriate error message if a conflict is detected.

#### **4\. Storage**

* Use any of the following options for data storage:  
  * In-memory storage (e.g., an array or Map).  
  * MongoDB (preferred), with Mongoose or Prisma.  
  * SQLite or PostgreSQL.

#### **5\. Documentation**

* Provide API documentation using Swagger (or another tool) to describe all endpoints and their request/response formats.

#### **6\. Code Quality**

* Ensure the code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices.  
* Include meaningful comments and error handling.

#### **7\. Testing**

* Write unit tests for your API endpoints using Jest, Mocha, or another testing framework.  
* Cover at least 70% of the codebase.

#### **8\. Bonus Points**

* Add a feature to update an existing booking.  
* Deploy the application to a free cloud service (e.g., Render, Vercel, or Railway) and provide the live URL.  
* Include authentication using JWT.

### **Submission Guidelines**

1. Push your code to a public GitHub repository.  
2. Include a `README.md` file with:  
   * Instructions on how to run the project locally.  
   * A list of features implemented.  
   * Any additional notes or assumptions made.  
3. Submit the link to your GitHub repository and your CV using the [submission form](https://calendly.com/career-key-m/nodejs-interview).  
   

### **Evaluation Criteria**

* Functionality: Does the service meet the requirements?  
* Code Quality: Is the code clean, modular, and maintainable?  
* Testing: Are the tests meaningful, and do they provide good coverage?  
* Documentation: Is the API well-documented and easy to understand?  
* Bonus Features: Have any additional features been implemented?
